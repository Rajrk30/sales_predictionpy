project title : sales prediction using machine learning


description: regression analysis(Linear Regression) is used to predict the actual sales and all the details are explained- 
within the project file(use jupyter notebook for better experience).


functionality of the project: 
          predicting sales based on the dataset provided to it by using machine learning.


how to run : install all the essentials (how to install===> enclosed within the code)
(this project is explained in detail within, use jupyter notebook for better experience.)

datasets: A dataset file is also included. Download the file and use that file in the code by specifying the path.
